### Critical Finding: AI Rating ≠ Your Taste

| Video | Win Record | AI Rating | Your Implicit Judgment |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| `2325621d` | 8/8 (100%) | 0.5 | **TOP TIER** |
| `e8f32302` | 5/5 (100%) | 0.5 | **TOP TIER** |

| `4422d8e6` | 0/5 (0%) | 0.7 | **BOTTOM TIER** |

*The AI rates your least favorites higher than your favorites.*

---

# Part 1: The Winner Pattern

## Context

Your top performer `2325621d` (8/8 wins) features:
- Staff doing "silent resistance" — complying maliciously
- Multiple shots showing different visual gags
- Absurdist workplace dynamics (cutting invisible pizza)
- No dialogue; physical/visual humor

Your notes on this video:
> *"The amusing part comes from the idea of silent resistance, where the staff comply with the request, but not in the way that the manager would expect or desire."*

Your second-best `4d9a4ccd` (8/11 wins) features:
- Server tricks chef, then eats the food himself
- Text dialogue (lip-sync to on-screen words)
- Twist payoff (surprise self-serving)
- Staff-on-staff dynamic

---

### Question 1.1: The Subversion Axis

Both winners involve staff **subverting** expected behavior — one through malicious compliance, one through deception.

**Your Question:**
When you prefer a video, how important is the element of "staff not doing what they're supposed to" (subversion, rebellion, cheekiness)?

- [ ] Essential — This is my core taste
- [ ] Very important — Most of my favorites have this
- [ ] Somewhat important — Nice to have but not required
- [ ] Not important — Coincidence in these examples
- [ ] Actively dislike — Prefer earnest/wholesome dynamics

```
Elaborate if needed:
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 1.2: Multi-Shot vs Single-Shot

In your 15 reasoning notes, you mention "multiple shots" and "single shot" as quality signals:

> *"Video B has multiple shots that hold visual gags that are engaging to interact with."*  
> *"Video A clip also has a single shot, which isn't always bad but generally points towards a simple setup."*

**Your Question:**
How much does the number of distinct scenes/shots affect your preference?

- [ ] A lot — Multi-shot almost always wins for me
- [ ] Moderately — It suggests effort and planning
- [ ] Slightly — Content matters more than shot count
- [ ] Not at all — I don't consciously notice this
- [ ] Depends — Multi-shot is better for some content types only

```
When does single-shot work well?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 1.3: Dialogue vs No-Dialogue

Two of your top winners have **no spoken dialogue**:
- `2325621d`: Visual gags with text overlay
- `4d9a4ccd`: Lip-sync to on-screen text

**Your Question:**
Do you have a preference for dialogue vs. visual/text-based humor?

- [ ] Prefer no dialogue — Visual humor is more universal
- [ ] Prefer text overlays — Modern, accessible, easy to replicate
- [ ] Prefer spoken dialogue — More naturalistic and engaging
- [ ] No preference — Depends on execution
- [ ] Actively avoid dialogue — Acting quality is often poor

```
What makes text-based delivery work vs. feel cheap?

# Part 2: The Loser Pattern

## Context

Your consistent loser `4b92e55d` (0/11 wins) features:
- Chef eagerly asking customer "how is it?"
- Escalating tension (getting in customer's face)
- Single emotional dynamic (validation-seeking)
- Requires animated acting

Your notes on this video:
> *"The trope of being very eager is somewhat amusing, it's not very culturally significant or funny but it's somewhat funny."*

Another loser `4422d8e6` (0/5 wins) features:
- Customer making "old timey jokes" ("I don't know, can you?")
- Worker reacting with exaggerated laughter
- Single interaction dynamic

Your notes:
> *"Some people don't enjoy old timey jokes, and the funny contrast is that the worker laughs more than expected."*

---

### Question 2.1: The "Somewhat Funny" Problem

Both losers are described as "somewhat amusing" but always lose. What's the difference between "somewhat funny" and "actually good"?

**Your Question:**
When a video is technically amusing but you still reject it, what's usually missing?

- [ ] Surprise — The joke is too predictable
- [ ] Substance — It's a thin concept stretched too far
- [ ] Freshness — The trope is too familiar or dated
- [ ] Craft — The execution doesn't elevate the premise
- [ ] Depth — There's nothing to discover on rewatch
- [ ] Something else: ________________

```
Elaborate:
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 2.2: The Validation-Seeking Trope

`4b92e55d` features a chef desperately seeking validation from a customer. This is a recognizable hospitality trope, but you never selected it.

**Your Question:**
What is it about "eagerness" or "validation-seeking" as a comedic premise that doesn't work for you?

- [ ] It's overdone — Too common in hospitality content
- [ ] It's cringe — The awkwardness doesn't feel earned
- [ ] It's one-note — There's no development or twist
- [ ] It's too real — Uncomfortably close to actual anxiety
- [ ] It requires too much acting skill to land
- [ ] Not sure — Need to think about this

```
Would this trope work if executed differently? How?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 2.3: The "Old Timey Jokes" Rejection

`4422d8e6` relies on "dad jokes" / "old timey" humor. You noted it has cultural relevance issues.

**Your Question:**
Is there a humor *style* that's fundamentally less compatible with your taste, regardless of execution?

- [ ] Yes — Some humor types just don't appeal to me
- [ ] Partially — Some styles need exceptional execution to work
- [ ] No — Any humor style can work if done well
- [ ] Not sure — Haven't identified clear patterns

```
If yes, which styles are harder for you to enjoy?

# Part 3: The Mismatch Variables

## Context

From v1.1 Question Battery, we identified these hidden variables:
- **Audio Paradox** — 2nd strongest predictor, rarely noticed
- **Anti-Hook Effect** — Flashy openings hurt preference
- **Replicability Delusion** — Discussed but doesn't predict

Now, from the 300 comparisons, we see:
- **AI ratings are inverted** — High AI scores correlate with YOUR rejection
- **Confidence patterns** — 44% "barely" decisions suggest missing decision criteria

---

### Question 3.1: What the AI Gets Wrong

The AI gave `4b92e55d` (your 0/11 loser) a rating of 0.7, and `2325621d` (your 8/8 winner) a rating of 0.5.

**Your Question:**
Looking at these two videos, what quality does your winner have that the AI is missing?

**Video 2325621d (WINNER, AI: 0.5):**
- Silent resistance, staff subversion
- Multiple visual gags
- Absurdist workplace comedy

**Video 4b92e55d (LOSER, AI: 0.7):**
- Validation-seeking escalation
- Tension building to close-up
- Animated acting required

```
What's the AI failing to capture?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 3.2: The "Barely" Confidence Signal

44% of your comparisons were "barely" confident. This suggests the decision criteria are unclear even to you in many cases.

**Your Question:**
When you mark "barely," what's typically happening?

- [ ] Both are good — Hard to pick a winner among equals
- [ ] Both are mediocre — Neither is exciting
- [ ] Different types — Comparing apples to oranges
- [ ] Missing information — I'd need to rewatch or think more
- [ ] Gut instinct — I just have a slight preference I can't articulate
- [ ] Energy low — Fatigue affecting decision quality

```
What would help you be more confident in close calls?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 3.3: The Fatigue Pattern

You wrote 12 reasoning notes in the first 20 comparisons, but 0 in the last 20.

**Your Question:**
Would a different annotation format help you capture reasoning throughout the session?

- [ ] Quick tags (e.g., "better tempo," "cleaner payoff")
- [ ] Binary attributes (e.g., "has twist: yes/no")
- [ ] Voice recording instead of typing
- [ ] Only ask for reasoning on "barely" decisions
- [ ] Show reasoning prompt only every N comparisons
- [ ] Current format is fine; I just got tired

```
Any other format ideas?

# Part 4: New Variables for v1.2 Schema

## Context

From your 15 reasoning notes, these concepts appeared that aren't captured in v1.1:

| Mentioned Concept | Current Schema Coverage | Frequency |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| "edgy" / "edginess" | ❌ Not captured | 2x |
| "brand dependent" / "brand fit" | ⚠️ Partial (strata) | 3x |
| "meme dependent" | ❌ Not captured | 1x |
| "improvised" vs "planned" | ❌ Not captured | 1x |
| "niche use case" / audience specificity | ⚠️ Partial (audience) | 2x |
| "cohesive" / "round" theme | ⚠️ Partial (narrative_flow) | 1x |
| "expressive" visuals | ❌ Not captured | 1x |
| "tempo" driven by music | ⚠️ Partial (audio) | 2x |

---

### Question 4.1: Edginess as a Variable

You mentioned videos being "edgy" twice. One winning example used rap music and a "personal staff culture" vibe.

**Your Question:**
What does "edgy" mean in your evaluation?

- [ ] Tone — Irreverent, slightly rebellious, not corporate
- [ ] Content — Touches on taboo or risky topics
- [ ] Style — Fast cuts, bold visuals, high energy
- [ ] Attitude — Staff showing personality, not performing "niceness"
- [ ] All of the above
- [ ] Something else: ________________

```
Is edginess always positive, or does it depend on context?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 4.2: Brand Dependency

You noted some videos are "brand dependent" — they only work for certain types of businesses.

From your reasoning:
> *"If a brand doesn't enjoy rap music, or have a more personal (implied) staff culture, then Video A clip may not be replicable."*

**Your Question:**
Should brand-dependency be a factor in σTaste scoring? How?

- [ ] Penalize heavily — Universal content is better
- [ ] Penalize slightly — More niche = more risk
- [ ] Neutral — Just categorize it, don't score it
- [ ] Reward slightly — Specificity can be a strength
- [ ] Reward heavily — Brand-specific content is more authentic

```
How would you define "brand dependency" for the schema?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 4.3: Planned vs Improvised

You penalized a video for feeling "improvised" and noted another was better because it "seems more planned."

**Your Question:**
How important is the sense of intentionality/planning to your preference?

- [ ] Very important — I strongly prefer content that feels constructed
- [ ] Moderately important — Planning shows professionalism
- [ ] Slightly important — Only notice when it's notably bad
- [ ] Not important — Spontaneous content can be great too

```
What signals "improvised" vs "planned" to you?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 4.4: Meme/Sound Dependency

You dismissed one video because it was "meme dependent (a video cut in)."

**Your Question:**
How should the schema treat content that relies on external memes, sounds, or trends?

- [ ] Penalize — It's borrowed creativity, less original
- [ ] Flag only — Neutral impact, but good to know
- [ ] Context-dependent — Some trend use is clever
- [ ] Neutral — Meme use is a valid creative choice

```
When does meme/sound dependency work vs. feel lazy?
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 4.5: Audience Specificity

You noted some content has "niche use cases" (e.g., gossip dynamics for "younger women, 15-25").

**Your Question:**
Should audience-specific content score differently than broadly accessible content?

- [ ] Universal content scores higher — Wider appeal is better
- [ ] Niche content scores higher — Specificity is a feature
- [ ] Score separately — Both have value in different contexts
- [ ] Neutral — The business should decide fit, not the schema

```
Elaborate:

# Part 5: The Confidence Calibration

## Context

Your confidence distribution:
- **Certain:** 54 (18%) — No reasoning notes needed
- **Somewhat:** 114 (38%) — Some notes
- **Barely:** 132 (44%) — High uncertainty

Cross-tab with ties:
- Certain: 0 ties
- Somewhat: 3 ties  
- Barely: 16 ties

---

### Question 5.1: What Makes You "Certain"?

When you mark "certain," what's happening internally?

- [ ] One video is clearly superior in every way
- [ ] One video has a specific quality I strongly value
- [ ] One video has a specific flaw that disqualifies it
- [ ] Gut reaction — I just know immediately
- [ ] Familiar territory — I've seen this comparison type before

```
Describe a "certain" moment from today's session if you remember:
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 5.2: What Creates Ties?

You had 19 ties. Looking at them, what typically caused you to not pick a winner?

- [ ] Both equally good
- [ ] Both equally mediocre
- [ ] Incomparable categories (apples to oranges)
- [ ] Tradeoffs — Each wins on different dimensions
- [ ] Couldn't focus enough to decide

```
Should the comparison UI handle ties differently? (e.g., force choice, or allow "incomparable"?)

# Part 6: Surfacing New Schema Variables

Based on Parts 1-5, these are **candidate new variables** for v1.2:

| Variable | Source Insight | Proposed Schema Location |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| `subversion_level` | Winners involve staff subverting expectations | `content.dynamics` |
| `shot_complexity` | Multi-shot preference mentioned 4+ times | `production.structure` |
| `dialogue_mode` | No-dialogue winners, text preference | `script.delivery_mode` |
| `concept_depth` | "Somewhat funny" losers lack substance | `humor_mechanics.depth` |
| `trope_freshness` | Old/dated tropes rejected | `content.originality` |
| `edginess_level` | Mentioned as positive signal | `tone.edginess` |
| `brand_dependency` | Some content is context-specific | `utility.brand_specificity` |
| `intentionality_signal` | Improvised feels worse | `production.planning_visible` |
| `meme_dependency` | External reference reliance | `content.external_dependency` |
| `audience_breadth` | Niche vs universal appeal | `utility.audience_specificity` |

---

### Question 6.1: Variable Priority

Looking at the list above, which variables would be **most useful** for the AI to capture?

**Rank your top 5 (1 = most valuable):**

```
1. _____________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________
4. _____________________________________________
5. _____________________________________________
```

### Question 6.2: Missing Variables

Is there anything you noticed in today's comparisons that isn't captured above?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________



_____________________________________________________________________________
```

### Question 6.3: Schema Complexity Tradeoff

Each new variable increases schema complexity. Should the model:

- [ ] Go deep — Add all useful variables, complexity is worth it
- [ ] Stay focused — Only add variables that strongly predict preference
- [ ] Layer it — Core schema small, extended schema for power users
- [ ] Let data decide — Test each variable's predictive power before adding

```
Any other thoughts on schema evolution?
