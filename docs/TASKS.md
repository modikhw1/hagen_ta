# Tasks to be acheived.

# 1. Create a reliable hidden variable/meaning cluster discovery, in order to create an understanding of σTaste, that will be a ever towards completion emerging evaluation model to discern what makes σTaste.

# 2. Create a balancing system that has a clear overview and high moldability, preferably in some visual way that doens't require prompts through ai. Changes can be implemented rapidly and data models stay reliable and usable.

# 3. Make σTaste-learning into an exportable cluster/meaning database, that can be plugged into the main app.
