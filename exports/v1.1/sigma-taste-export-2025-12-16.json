One is a slightly amusing and entertaining video (making the latté), that isn't exactly humorous but has a low energy flow to it, where the viewer may find it amusing to see a customer trying to make a latté. The other video has a format that is more accessible and easy to replicate, but also requires to have a good story, since the one retold in the video is specific to what the person is saying.",

The second video is harder to replicate, but has a more engaging and creative premise. The video of the barista requires some animated acting, which he does well. The acting in the first video is slightly less amusing.",

Both are playing on absurdism, but the first video has a tempo and also young attractive women playing out the sketch. The first one has a more fun premise, and the result of the misunderstanding is more fun than the other. ",

The idea of proposing with that type of camera reveal is clever. Video B (ffbc9f08) (Video B (ffbc9f08) (ffbc9f08), ffbc9f08) has a somewhat amusing premise, but the payoff isn't very strong in itself (The cashier taking the card due to feeling annoyed). Video B (ffbc9f08) (Video B (ffbc9f08) (ffbc9f08), ffbc9f08) is likely more replicable, since Video A (42887f4b) (Video A (42887f4b) (42887f4b), 42887f4b) needs to replace the product in question.",

It has a slow paced entertainment value, where the viewer wants to see how well the \"customer\" does a latté, which I assume is engaging for some viewers. Video B (0c3565fa) (Video B (0c3565fa) (0c3565fa), 0c3565fa) has the make up of a somewhat strong premise, but isn't very funny in the end. The idea of asking co workers in order to hurry up, ending with clapping, and seeing the customers confusion, isn't a very funny payoff. But the absurdism is there, just not performed great. No one stands out as very good.",
