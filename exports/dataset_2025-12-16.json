A very simple premise and the humor is accessible. In the end, a black and white filter is applied with text going from top to bottom, establishing an \"end of movie credits\" visual, \"directed by Dream on Productions\" and \"Starring a very hungry employee\".

It is somewhat creative, not extremely clever or amusing.\n\nReplicability: The replicability of this video would likely rely on the ability of the customer to recreate the video in their own business setting. Some creativity is required for this.\n\nAnalysis Notes: The joke is played out as a scenario where one person is about to eat a dessert, hearing screams when attempting to bite. The joke is that the person eating the dessert is actually dreaming, sleeping in a car, and biting his colleague. The video description initially describes this idea, that the employee has been serving desserts all day (implying that he dreams about it, and is seen later biting his collague, implying that he's doing something in a waked up state that he didn't realize in his dream).",

        "notes": "[GOOD]\n\nThe concept is somewhat amusing and relates an unprofessional and relatable dynamic to a professional environment. The pacing is good, and the humour quite wholesome and fun. The premise is somewhat creative.\n\nReplicability: The video can likely be replicated in a bar, restaurant or café environment. The trope is likely culturally more relatable and recognizable from an American audience, despite the dynamic between siblings being universally known. The video is replicable but play of physical humor, which requires animated performances to make the concept really have an impact. The video also has some interesting editing, not too much but not the easiest.\n\nBrand/Tone: Any brand wanting to go for a personalized feeling, relatability, and taking away the boundaries between the brand and everyday life could make use of this concept. Sibling dynamics feels familiar and maybe take away professionalism, which may be something a big chain/brand would want to avoid. The humour is accessible, but is likely to be enjoyed by teens more than adults (13-18).\n\nAnalysis Notes: The premise sets a sibling dynamic in a work environment, where two workers play the role of a brother and a sister, which is amusing in an environment where professional boundaries are expected. The way the scene plays out, the younger brother (trope) annoys the older sister, by throwing straws at her to annoy her, and just being a nuisance, while keeping eye contact. This trope isn't very famous or commonly known, but the premise, set by the text overlay, makes the scenes belong and create meaning.",

        "notes": "[GOOD]\n\nAn absurdist concept that is playing on a fictional relationship dynamic between two male workers, that is shown to have a romantic reconciliation when the disagreement initially was work related. The video isn't the most creative, but rather plays of physical humor and a sense of absurdism that has the highpoint of the two workers about to kiss.\n\nReplicability: The video is likely somewhat easy to replicate, and likely looks best in a light and clean environment, such as a bar during daytime. Since the premise has to do with an absurdist love entaglement between two men, it would require a type of openness from the business replicating the video, as well as a willingness of two staff members to play out the sketch. The video is also reliant on physical comedy, which makes the recording and the animated acting an important part of the video.\n\nBrand/Tone: This concept is likely popular with a Gen Z crowd. The video is short and to the point, and has to do with a strange love dynamic that is not often associated with a work environment. I would guess that most brands would avoid this type of setup, unless it's a modern and \"laid-back\" brand that is open to playing on these themes. With that said, the humour is quite accessible despite it bringing up cultural dynamics (homosexuality).\n\nAnalysis Notes: The humour in this is playing on a form of absurdity of two male co-workers reconciling after what is assumed to be a disagreement/confrontation during a rush. The text-overlay describes the timeline \"you didn't hate each other, it was just the rush\" - disagreement during rush, the workers have the common realization, the video shows the reconciliation. The amusing part of this video comes from the facial expressions that make the workers seem like a young, innocent couple, with a big infatuation for each other. The exaggerated smiling makes it look very strange, and the big payoff comes when the workers meet in the last shot, about to kiss each other, but being cut off before that happens. This setup of finishing the recording before the big \"wow\" moment is a trope that is used sometimes. In this case, two men kissing would be the most extreme part of this video, which makes it amusing how it stops right before they kiss.",

        "notes": "[GOOD]\n\nThe concept is simple and somewhat amusing. The meta-perspective of a business creating this type of edgy content is amusing. It's a one-shot recording, which makes it simple and to-the-point but also makes the concept not very clever or memorable.\n\nReplicability: The video is perhaps not the most replicable, as it requires a scene that finds the tonal balance between scary/extreme and still accessible. This version has a worker outside of the restaurant setting, next to a car, which requires a car but also a willingness to setup a scene that requires that as a setup. The creator would preferably have a willingness to go outside of the normal in order to get the scene set up.\n\nBrand/Tone: The concept would likely be more useful for a business with a tone that is a bit more grown. The joke contains a somewhat dark premise, but it's still somewhat accessible and not alienating or scaring. It would more depend on if the brand finds it accessible to go \"edgy\", as a premise like this has a lot of personality, and themes like \"mafia\" or extravagant recourses for doing things incorrectly may not be the safest path for a bigger, more \"safe\" brand.\n\nAnalysis Notes: The humour comes from the stark contrast between the words of the woman, and the visuals. The woman (text overlay) is answering a question relating to her opinion of someone trying out another restaurant. While talking, giving a neutral answer, she is seen to close the trunk on someone with their mouth and hands tied, which is a trope that is popular within mafia-movies or culture.\n\nThe joke being that the person in the car is the person who has tried out another restaurant, which is actually seen to be unacceptable by the restaurant worker answering the question (the worker is standing outside in work clothes). It's not explicitly clear that the person in the trunk is a customer, but it is implied.",

        "notes": "[GOOD]\n\nThe premise is not the most humorous, but plays on a dynamic between a manager and a worker. The series of shots, as well as the worker looking into the camera while performing them, makes it engaging. The random tasks, as it's defined, are actually quite random and the type of tasks that one wouldn't normally do. This gives the content a visual element that maintains the viewer.\n\nThe video uses a TikTok trend to maintain the tempo, where the person mimics the lyrics with their lips.\n\nReplicability: This concept relies on making the premise \"pop\" using well thought out video shots. In this video, an attractive young woman plays the main role which captures attention. I think the core concept isn't the most engaging or amusing, but it's quietly engaging and has good pacing. To replicate this, the content creator would have to find good examples (could likely be copied from the video), of tasks that are deemed to be \"small\" or random. This requires some creativity that may form a barrier or unwant to perform the script.\n\nBrand/Tone: The tone is generally accessible and doesn't contain very edgy themes. It plays on the power dynamic that can be found in the work place, but doesn't include anything too malicious or adult.\n\nAnalysis Notes: The humour is partly about the persons frustration, but also build on an unexplained assumption that the manager has a tendency to \"make up\" tasks in order to get the most out of the worker. Since the worker is actually getting paid for their time, it's somewhat of a \"using\" dynamic where the worker doesn't have a say, despite the wishful hope of getting to take it easy, or focus on more engaging tasks. The worker follows the instructions, but has something of a silent resistance which can be expressed in the text overlay \"When ... the manager suddenly finds random jobs for you\". Where suddenly and random are two words that hold a form of judgement/standoffish tone.",

        "notes": "[GOOD]\n\nIt's a funny premise that is presented in an engaging and creative way. The managers frustrated expressions while throwing money is a funny juxtaposition (the idea of throwing money is a somewhat edgy cultural trope). The video is shot well and each shot, with it's updated text overlay (showing decreasing values with each shot) is engaging. Each shot also views a different setting, making it engaging and catchy. The video relies on a trend \"sound\", of a person counting from 1 to 8 in a rhytmic sequence, and having the video follow that sound. It's not reliant to a very heavy degree, or something that would go against the \"cleverness\" of the original idea/visual execution, but it affects the content's stand alone strength.\n\nReplicability: The script can be replicated by 2-4 people. The concept in it's current form can be altered into a bar/café or restaurant setting (which it is), so it is can be replicated. However, it does require some planning and likely some time to set up in a good way, since a big part of the enjoyment comes from the video shots and framing. 8 shots in total with different \"sets\" may be time consuming.\n\nBrand/Tone: I believe this premise has a wide appeal, but may cater more towards an adult demographic. The managers perspective will play on the feeling of a dwindling payoff for hard work, which is something that adults may relate to. Responsibility, bills, a feeling of being used or the system working against the person in society. But it's still engaging.",

The absurdism in how the manager is very direct, almost threatening, as well as using unique and creative threats can be found to be amusing.\n\nReplicability: The concept can be replicated with fewer staff, but I believe the video is improved with new staff receiving different \"threats\". The premise can be replicated in my types of settings. The editing should not be very advanced, since it's 4 shots.\n\nBrand/Tone: The tone in this is quite edgy, and would likely work better for a target audience of young adults or adults (18-30). The reason is that work/manager dynamics/pressure is quite threatening or can be perceived to be \"dangerous\". The theme is presented in a light-hearted way, but it's not very wholesome despite it being humorous.\n\nAnalysis Notes: Good analysis",

        "notes": "[MEDIOCRE]\n\nIt's a common trope about a service worker getting an order very late in her shift. In an exaggerated way, the text overlay points towards a new order coming in just one minute before her shift ends. Picking up a new bite to eat, in relation to the apparent entry of the customer, takes the concept to it's high point, culminating in her screaming.\n\nI don't think the script is very creative or original. Some people may find it amusing to see the person yell, especially profanity, but it doesn't do much more than give a heightened emotional feeling. It's not clever or memorable. The sketch may use the fact that it's an attractive woman to its advantage.\n\nIt doesn't contain dialogue and relies on a TikTok \"sound\", which can sometimes be a useful tool if the original sketch or idea doesn't contain enough strength on it's own. But not all content without dialogue is bad.\n\nI don't know about Cocomelon reference.\n\nReplicability: This video is likely simple to replicate. It's a one shot recording of a woman moving into the scene with food, looking sidewards signaling that someone has entered the shot.\n\nBrand/Tone: I believe any brand wanting to use this type of content should be mindful of profanity, but also to give the feeling that any customer wanting help is problematic. This attitude is generally not useful when presenting a balanced brand tone. This could potentially work for a somewhat edgy one man, or smaller team, operation. In those cases, it's not always a problem in speaking directly and showing a lot of personality, even when edgy or using profanity.",

Kissing the server of the forehead is an absurd reaction, and the dancing is also quite unexpected.\n\nOverall, the concept can be replicated quite easily, requiring a person playing the customer that can sell the different personalities, both sad and overly happy. It's not a very creative or original concept, but is amusing because of the unexpected nature of the shift, as well as the kiss on the head which is quite an unreasonable reactor to receiving food.\n\nThis type of content is likely more fitting to a small business with a familiar crowd, and not a generalized crowd.

In a relationship or friendly interaction with food, it is sometimes preferable to eat with similar pacing, or at least take some time, in order to enjoy the food and company. In this concept, the male finishes the food before the woman takes her first bite, which is an exaggerated way of showing making the point. The way this video is setup with editing, makes it so that the twist of the man finishing his meal is almost \"snuck\" in, and the payoff is mainly a visual one.\n\nThe video is somewhat amusing but not funny. Rather it makes light of a dynamic where one part of the relationship may become surprised/annoyed by the sudden change in circumstances. The video can be replicated by restaurants, since the premise centers around food and quick eating. The concept centers around two guests inside the restaurant, and does not immediately create a theme/idea that one connects the brand/restaurant/staff with, which can also work sometimes. An observational sketch can also be effective marketing material for a restaurant.\n\nOverall, the pacing is good and can be replicated somewhat easily, but requires some good editing and preferably some good production value/quality, as the visual payoff plays a big part.",

The order has dietary restrictions but makes it very hard to satisfy the request, due to the amount of restrictions. The chef looks annoyed and fills the plate with simple garnish, and has the server go with the plate to the customer. Some humor is found in the simple interplay between the chef and the server, but it's also somewhat amusing seeing how the chef satisfies the request, even if it's assumed that the customer will not be satisfied, as it isn't a cohesive dish with any type of planning or ingredients that can satisfy the hunger of the customer.\n\nThe concept isn't the most creative, as this scenario has been seen many times in pop culture. The punchline (of serving something that is sure to be sent back) isn't either the most original or amusing. Overall, the video has good pacing and can likely be replicated by similar businesses. It would require some good production to make the serving part stick out and feel like a payoff. With lower production quality, the visuals would fall flat and some of the comedic effect would go to waste.",

        "notes": "A simple concept that centers around a dynamic between a manager and a worker. In this sketch, the worker is seen to be nervous around her manager, implying that the manager is rather stern, or that the worker has a tendency to be rattled under pressure, or both. When making mistakes, there is communication happening with eye contact and facial expressions, showing that the manager is getting increasingly noticing of the workers flaws. In a work environment, this is culturally viewed as not the best, since a good relation with the employer is more likely to result in a longer working relationship.\n\nIt's a somewhat amusing concept with good pacing. It is engaging to see how the worker makes mistakes, trying to play it off, while the manager looks right behind her shoulder, which in of itself adds to the absurdity. Normally, the manager would attempt to lighten the pressure, instead of adding more. This may point towards a stern and rigid boss. In the interplay between the two personalities, some humor arises with increasing pressure with each mistake.\n\nOverall, it's a somewhat creative sketch that has good pacing. For replicability, it requires a person who can play each role, which isn't the hardest (stern manager, innocent looking worker). Depending on the business, the sketch contents may be replaced or aligned to a scenario more likely in the particular business. It has music, but doesn't rely on content within the music. The concept has no dialogue, but the premise is set with the text overlay.",

The premise is presented in text, showing that the worker doesn't recollect the customers appearance. With each continuous shot, the worker is seen to be looking around, somewhat clueless and with an unengaged facial expression, figuring out who ordered the food. When he finds himself unsuccessful inside the restaurant, he looks towards the outside seating area, not finding the customer there either. Then he goes all the way to the street outside, which highlights how unintelligent or unfocused his attempt is, that builds on top of the premise that he initially forgot the appearance of the customer, which in itself is somewhat amusing and points towards a trope of a \"unknowing, fleeting and unfocused young person\". This trope is common in media/entertainment, and is usually reserved for young men that add some comedic relief.\n\nThe video has good pacing and plays on absurdist humor, with a personality type implied. It's short and not too original. It's replicable, having one actor play out the scene.",

The amusing part is where the worker is entering the business premises, and acting like a rockstar with throwing his jacket, and having a colleague taking a photo with him. This somehow implies that his status has skyrocketed from a simple google review, however good it may be for the business. The humour can be found in the contrast in how an achievement can be overly celebrated, especially if others validate that world view of framing. This concept uses absurdity in status relationships, where someone with normal status (a worker) suddenly is implied to have become famous over a google review - implying that his cooking or service would change his life.\n\nTo that it's also amusing seeing how a seemingly normal dude, without too much enthusiasm, simply acts along as if it's a normal reaction.\n\nOverall, it's a simple concept that can likely be replicated. It uses background music in order to amplify the rockstar theme that is presented. It's not the most creative or well thought out concept, but it's short and amusing to watch. For someone to replicate it, an animated or exaggerated reaction from the colleagues would be useful, which isn't hard.",

Instead of serving the customer, the worker insists on the customer leaving, making the scenario unprofessional but for that reason a bit absurd. This type of reaction is not unheard of for service workers, generally prioritizing their own energy and sometimes taking shortcuts. In this case not serving a customer.\n\nThe video has good pacing, it's easy to watch and cuts quickly. It doesn't rely in dialogue or a script, but uses and follows the structure of a TikTok \"sound\" likely popular in the language of Swedish. The participants in the content mimics the dialogue with their lips, with the pre-recorded sound used to center the sketch.\n\nOverall, it's not a very original video, and to a big extent for the reasons of using a pre-made sound, as well as the sound not having a very big emotional impact. The concept is a bit edgy, and would likely not be the most replicable for any business wanting to give a professional feeling (customer service shown to be lower priority than workers attitudes). Overall, the video is simple to replicate, but uses a sound which isn't the most creative or interesting.",

        "notes": "The concept is simple and is only two separate shots, with one setting up the punchline and the other delivering the punchline. The video takes the perspective of the customer initially (POV), where the cashier gives the message that the business is short staffed, which may be the result of a conversation asking for help or any other type of request that gives that response (although the previous part of the dialogue hasn't been included). In the second shot, another angle can be seen when the cashier's colleague is attempting to reach some items far up on the bar shelf, while struggling. The twist is that the staff isn't short-staffed, as in there are few workers available, but rather that they are short physically and can't perform certain duties. This is an amusing twist that uses wordplay to surprise the viewer, with physical humour that delivers the punchline (a worker struggling to reach an item far up).\n\nThe video is simple and somewhat creative. For this concept to be replicable, there needs to be a way to set the scene up where a worker cannot reach a certain place. In this case, it's an item in a bar shelf. In some cases, this type of scene setup would not always work. There would also have to be a staff member (or someone else to partake in the concept) that is short.\n\nAlso, since the joke centers around a play on words short-staffed/short staff, it's likely that the joke would not work as well when translated to another language, making the video less reliant as a script that can be recreated to the same effectiveness as in English.",

The video lacks dialogue, but rather is played out by the two staff roleplaying and mimicking the lines with their lips, while the dialogue is presented on the screen itself. The twist of the server eating the food give the concept a payoff that is surprising and absurd. The concept is somewhat easy to replicate, but contains music that is somewhat meme/period dependent. The sound can be interchanged to fit another period, since it isn't \"linked\" to the concept in itself, but some music may be needed to carry the concept as the dialogue is in text for on the screen.",

When the server moves through the premise, holding some items on a serving tray, she seems occupied for the moment. Despite this being clear, the customer says excuse me, being met with \"just one second\", with the same thing happening twice, showing that the customer is asking a lot. The server then gets enough and throws the items (bottles), which shows a burst of temper almost saying \"ok, I you really need help, then let me help\", but in an annoyed way. It's a trope that is common between parents and kids, with the kids asking for so much that the parents lash out. In this sketch, it happens but in an absurd way, where the server does something unprofessional by throwing items on the floor.\n\nAfter this sudden shift, the customer is asked what he would like. But instead of having a clear request, the customer now asks for time, adding insult to injury. Now the server has lost her focus, not being helpful to the first customer or this customer. The video ends with the server looking into the camera, almost in disbelief and seemingly annoyed.\n\nThis concept is not the most creative or original, but the premise is somewhat amusing (the reaction by the server and the audacity of the customer). The video has faster pacing and many edits in a short span of time, making the video somewhat harder to re-create. It doesn't lean on dialogue or a strong idea that can be conveyed over many scenes. Rather, it's a mismatch of intentions/desires played out over a simple scenario.",

This type of request is normal, but in a work environment, it's usually viewed by the staff as an opportunity to take it easier than normal. The manager, viewing it as labor being paid but not used to the extent that it can, requests for them to work even if it's slower for them moment.\n\nThe humorous part comes from the staff, in a series of sketches, performs their normal duties, but in an absurdist way. Examples are cutting an imaginary pizza in an empty pizza box, opening the door for no one, taking an order for an empty table, adding invisible food to a plate. The amusing part comes from the idea of silent resistance, where the staff comply with the request, but not in the way that the manager would expect or desire.\n\nThe sketch is somewhat amusing, and the pacing is good, where each scene adds to the concept. It's likely somewhat easy to replicate, although the script would require 3-4 individuals to play the staff and the manager. The script likely works best for a \"tight crew\" type establishment, where the work culture is personal and not too polished. The tone is not the most professional, as it plays on the idea of staff revolting or making light of a professional dynamic. For a brand that want to present a personal, and maybe 'human to a fault' tone, it could work.",

For example \"Can I help you\", would normally be met with the request of the customer, but in this case, it's answered with \"I don't know, can you?\" which is a subtle way of mistranslating the intention of the workers question. Instead of playing along and forcing a laugh, which is the normal way of handling an old timey joke, the cashier laughs in a very exaggerated way, indicating that he is not really wanting to play along in the joke structure. Some people don't enjoy old timey jokes, and the funny contrast is that the worker laughs more than expected. The amusing part is seeing how the worker reacts to the jokes.\n\nThis script is somewhat original, but the concept requires animated reactions in the participants. The old timey joke structure has cultural relevance in certain countries more.",

When receiving food the plate can sometimes be hot, and in this video, the customer is told to be careful. The small and quite subdued payoff is of the person touching the plate still. It's not very amusing, but a subdued observational sketch. The emotional impact isn't high, but for this sketch, it simply shows a simple human behaviour.\n\nIt's not a very creative or impactful sketch. But it's easy to replicate and humorous to the right type of audience. I believe younger people, perhaps gen z and female, may think this is cute or fun.",

The dynamic is between a customer who has a lot of attitude, dismissive and setting a lot of expectations on the server. The server plays his role as a soft and helpful person, but this isn't appreciated but rather taken to an extreme where the girl plays a really bratty persona. The script isn't very strong or clever, it seems rather improvised with a lot of takes showing \"behind the scenes\", breaking character and showing how the two actors seem to be enjoying themselves.\n\nUltimately, the premise is engaging and can be deemed to be amusing for people who like back and forths when a bratty attitude meets a kind person, which isn't unheard of in the service industry. The video is replicable as a back and forth between characters, but the script isn't very focused or centered around a premise. Rather it's an improvisation. For this reason, it's not really replicable step by step, unless the content creator aiming to replicate the concept changes many lines to fit into their own style of joke.",

The customer, that takes POV perspective (the camera represents the customer) describes her order while the barista attempts to juggle many things at once. It seems that the barista has very short patience, or at least being used to getting orders done fast. For anyone working in service, it's an amusing and relatable dynamic where one person is not following the others emotional state. During the script, it is both apparent in the increasingly annoyed words, but also the facial expressions, of the barista. The customer on the other hand, seems oblivious, or at least not wanting to speed up in order to satisfy the baristas urgency of getting tasks done quickly.\n\nUltimately, it's a somewhat amusing concept that shows the divide between two different types of people, and the subtle ways conflict seems to arise in small gestures or tone changes. Overall, it's not hard to replicate the script, but a lot of the emotional impact comes from the animated expression of the barista.",

For this reason, there is music that sets a tense emotion, while the camera moves past the worker (indicating that the customer is walking past), and the worker gives a serious look towards the person. It's somewhat amusing. Normally the norm is to pretend like everything is good, in a business-customer dynamic, even if there is a feeling of disappointment. Playing out the underlying feeling is somewhat absurd.\n\nIt's a concept that can be replicated, but it's not very original or creative. For some brands it may be considered a bit too tough or confrontative. The actor also needs to find the balance between toughness and lightness, making it comedic instead of off-putting.",

        "notes": "An amusing concept showing two men sending affection towards each other, in an exaggerated way. It's a funny trope about a really close relationship, or really intimate romantic relationship, where the signs of affections cannot be contained between two people. Putting it in the work context, it becomes an absurd thought. Especially since it's two men, and the air kisses and hand touching takes it over the top.\n\nThe concept is fun and lighthearted, and plays on emotional themes as well as wholesomeness. It can be replicated by other brands that can manage a bit riskier concept, as it has to do with love and in general, workplace relations. It's also amusing because it's not normal for two coworkers being so close, and the phrase \"10 hour playdate\" is engaging. It makes it sound like they are two children or animals, when the work environment is normally more professional in it's tone.\n\nIt may also be a script that works because of the overlay text, that may not be as effective when translating to another language. Playdate as a concept is more of a culturally english (american) thing. The phrasing may not be as effective in another language.\n\nLast, despite it being a fun concept it relies on execution. For a smaller production crew, or someone not experienced, it may land flat. It is also a question if two workers are available to perform this type of content, which may hold embarassment.",

First that the service worker would have such strong emotions towards a customer, which implies that the worker-customer relationship is like a friend relationship, or any other childish dynamic. It's also absurd because of the extremes the worker takes to avoid a person, crawling and leaving the premises.\n\nOverall, it's not an original concept. It's also not a useful theme for brands wanting to uphold wholesome or inclusive values, as avoiding or generally not being accountable isn't a trait normally associated with a responsible or high quality brand.",

Instead of understanding the traditional meaning of two fingers (2), they assume it's a peace sign, or even a kawaii peace sign, which is a popular with the younger generation or females of that age. The joke plays on the misunderstanding, and after two cuts forth and back, the servers realize that the chef means two and not kawaii peace sign.\n\nIt's a replicable script that has some creativity to it.

There isn't any dialogue, rather the premise is presented in text and the workers use their body movements to illustrate how they relate to the work. By spraying into their mouths (perhaps toxic, cleaning spray), and cutting their forearms with kitchen knives, or putting a bag over their heads, it illustrates that they don't enjoy the work.\n\nThe concept is engaging and can be amusing, but it plays on a rather low/depressed idea of not enjoying work, even to the extent of considering self-harm. This script can be replicated easily, and may have some engaging or amusing aspects to it, but is a no-go for any brand wanting to maintain a wholesome or positive feel. This would maybe work for a solo business with a very edgy brand tone, but even then, joking about self harm isn't very useful.",

The worker, in an absurd response, takes the sprinkles and throws it on his colleague. It's a very unexpected reaction, and has some chock value that makes the video slightly absurd. It plays on meanness, but the joke isn't very creative, it's centers around an extreme reaction to something seemingly light, as a disagreement/request for an item change. It's not hard to replicate, but may be a bit too extreme for a normal brand and isn't wholesome/easy as such brands would prefer. This gives a feeling of unprofessionalism, but a younger audience may find this engaging.",

The video has pacing and becomes increasingly more tense, with the high point of the chef asking \"how is it\", very close to the customers face. This takes the absurdity to it's highest point, signifying that the chef is willing to violate norms just to get a feedback/validation.

The premise centers around a worker with his colleague in a restaurant setting, where one is on a break and the other is not. The worker on his break seems very relaxed, which is amusing in contrast to his colleague who seems stressed. The audio effects and focused expression on the colleague tells that it's a divide in how they both perceive the situation. The amusing part comes partly from the text, saying that there is less than a minute left on the break, but that the person is still committed to relaxing, although his/her help could really be useful. It frames the worker on break as selfish, and self-serving, at the expense of his colleague. The norm would be to be as helpful as possible, in order to fit into the social group, and at least not make it obvious that he/she does not care enough to help the colleague. This type of meanness/selfishness can be amusing to observe.\n\nThe concept can be replicable, but it relies on movement in the shot rather than originality in ideas or dialogue. It doesn't have a strong payoff, but rather has a flat energy level. The payoff relies on how stressed the worker looks, and the overall tone that the video has.",

The pacing is good, as the script has a sort of increasing absurdity. First, the customer agrees, where he/she may think that the price would go down, due to the human inclination to rate him/herself highly due to wanting to have good confidence. In this case, he speaks with his colleague and they look towards the customer, almost in a high school girl group fashion, where judging others harshly on appearance, and not taking accountability for emotional damage/hurtfulness, may be more common (trope). The discussion between the colleagues seem to come to a conclusion that they have more negative things to say, judging on their expressions. After the discussion, the worker turns to the cashier and says \"the price is 20 dollars\", which is almost double the original number. Meaning, instead of lowering the price due to perceived attractiveness, it's instead increased because of the opposite (non-attractiveness), ending the sketch with a punchline that is shocking but draws a laugh due to it's absurdity.\n\nOverall, the script is funny and somewhat original. It can be replicated and may be helped with an animated style of acting to sell the jokes.",

The POV is of the customer, and the person is about to pay, considering adding tip. The person in the register awaits the customers action. While in the customers POV, the watcher of the video hears \"I'll tip him 5%...no his service was great, I'll give him 10...maybe 30%\", while the customer hovers over different tipping options on the screen. It is implied that it is the customers internal dialogue, from a POV perspective, and we are hearing his thoughts while the finger hovers over the different options. It then turns out, in a twist, that the cashier was actually the voice, meaning that the finger movement (considering what tip to give) is unrelated to the voice, meaning that the cashier was attempting to guide the customer towards paying more. Ultimately, the customer says \"Can you shut up?\", giving the payoff of the concept.\n\nIt's a strong script that can be replicated by other restaurants or businesses that have a tipping function. It's requires some editing and voiceover work, but other than that it's not too hard, it's a one shot video. Overall, this is a high quality script.",

It plays on a trope of having an enemy with a tension between two people. But in this case, the dynamic is that the customer (POV) has been in the wrong earlier (yelling at the worker), which makes it amusing that he/she would pretend like nothing happened, just walking by expecting it to be forgotten or not acknowledged. The camera shot, moving to left to right, showing the POV perspective, shows that the worker has a sort of tense relationship with the customer, with a facial expression that is suspicious, which is amusing. This type of relationship would normally be reserved when someone has really wronged someone. Especially not in a professional environment.\n\nThe concept is original, but the premise doesn't land perfectly in its execution. It's simple to replicate, but the theme is a bit heavier and not so simple, light and wholesome. The idea of having enemies, even though in a playful way, plays on a trope that may have more weight than other types of videos.",

It's a somewhat amusing premise, but the execution is tricky to really sell the uncomfortable/annoying dynamic. The viewer doesn't either know beforehand that one of the characters has a vehicle, and not the other. And the issue of someone trying to win a favor, in this context, isn't really a high stakes situation. Many would think \"why not help him?\", attempting to be helpful when possible. It's not a common enough trope, with enough emotional weight, to make the script worthwhile or interesting.",

This could point towards a staff relationship where odd or unique things are shared between the staff, like what a customer may be doing. The sketch evolves into the person, who was to not make it obvious, find himself very close to the person in a sudden way (edit). This type of surprising or high effect humor is popular with a younger audience, who enjoy a type of high impact shift in energy, or surprise in the form of sudden movements. The concept isn't hugely creative, but the premise draws one in. It points towards a kind of \"inside knowledge\" between staff in service environments, which may be interesting for others.",

This makes it so that the staffer, wanting to avoid the conversation, drags the moment on by cleaning everything meticulously, even things that are normally not meant to be cleaned or expected to be cleaned. This is a somewhat amusing skit showing how humans will do anything than face bad emotions. The scenes gives the video it's meaning, the visuals.\n\nThis sketch can likely be recreated both in service environments (stores, restaurants, cafés), as well as other types of shops where there is a dynamic between staff and higher ups. The concept doesn't build or have a very strong climax, but it's somewhat engaging and not boring.",

It's a somewhat amusing response and quite absurd in it's structure. The pacing is good and doesn't require thought out dialogue to carry the premise. Rather, it's a funny image seeing the staff eating the customers food, while hearing the customer in confusion wondering what is going on.\n\nThe sketch can likely be replicated for other businesses.

It contains music, but not to drive the meaning but rather to give the video some substance.

This type of communication can be after a some time together, where the boss can be stern with his guidance and speak directly to what he/she expects. In this case, use your head is used but then in a somewhat absurdist way interpreted as using your head in the working tasks. The boss tapes a salt shaker and has the worker shake salt on food, which is a somewhat amusing way of interpreting the line use your head. Ultimately, it's a somewhat engaging premise, that points towards a dramatic way of communicating, but resolving in an unexpected visual of the team working in an inefficient way.\n\nThe script has some originality, and the visual is funny. The script can be translated into other businesses, not just restaurant. There needs to be some creativity, for example changing out the prop (salt shaker) to something else that can be bound to the persons head.",

The premise being that the staff is fed up, and she feels like it's an emotional process having to recieve criticism or take accountability. The line \"I'm already crying\" is a type of gen z humor of being very emotionally unhealthy or unbalanced, which makes for a somewhat amusing payoff in the situation in question.\n\nThe script relies on a TikTok sound, which tells that the script in itself isn't strong. The script doesn't use dialogue, but rather relies on the TikTok sound, and the facial expressions/movements of the main subject and her colleague, looking at her with a stern look. It's not a very humorous or funny video, but it's maybe relatable and fun to a younger audience, and probably of women more than men.",

The payoff is that she looks exhausted and with a TikTok sound says \"it's not about the money\", saying that she would feel inclined to do it even without the question of payment. This points towards a somewhat unhealthy working dynamic, which can resonate with people as an interesting trope. With that said, it's not a very useful script for any business that wants to give a wholesome or inviting tone to the brand. The video uses a TikTok sound, and isn't very original as a stand alone concept.",

The script isn't very creative, and doesn't have any lines, but rather relies on a funny cutaway of a child dancing. The engaging aspect of this video is how seamless the transition is into the clip of the child dancing. The issue with this script/concept is that it relies on other media, which makes it not as strong alone just based on the script. The issue is the same with music/sound effects, where attention or engagement comes from something other than the premise/script.\n\nThe video has good pacing, isn't very long. But it's tone is quite edgy, and is likely more engaging for a young crowd, and maybe girls. This makes the video not appropriate for a brand looking to cater to a large audience, with both young people and people who are a bit older.",

The script centers around the bartender/barista, preparing two drinks and handing one to the person on the other side of the bar, inviting for some connection over gossip. The person on the other end signals through text on the screen that she would rather not, and then, the person takes back the drink and continues walking, almost as if the person wanting to respect the boundaries of the lives of the others (the subject of gossip), is in the wrong. It's almost like implying that we are living in the \"world\" of the barista, where any perspective other than the one where gossiping is good, isn't appreciated. This gives a funny element to the video. Of course, this type of theme has a lot of personality, and is probably more engaging for a younger, (maybe) female crowd that understand or find enjoyment in this type of attitude being blatantly showcased.\n\nThis script can likely be replicated, and it's clever and funny. But the script would not fit the tone of most brands, perhaps a younger or more hip audience. Also, gossip in general, if being packaged as \"what right\" within a sketch, is a somewhat agitating theme and not wholesome exactly. Gossip, sex are two themes that may go against brand guidelines to make it accessible and wholesome for a general audience.",

For a restaurant owner, this makes it possible to record within the restaurant and use for marketing purposes, while making the brand feel relatable that the owner would have a fun and absurdist attitude towards a somewhat neutral question (love, or making money). The script isn't super creative, and I think a lot of the success of a concept like this is the execution and animation in the editing after. It's not hard to replicate, but it doesn't have a very strong payoff.",

I believe the joke is that his colleague, the woman doing the admin, is busy doing work that he is meant to be doing. Then when he sees above her shoulder that she is doing admin work, he steers away and the sound effect plays. Can be replicated, but I prefer videos that don't rely on sound effects or music. This video isn't very original or amusing, but has good pacing and keeps the interest.",

The buildup is about the employee asking to wear headphones, which can sometimes be rejected due to various reasons. The boss is kind, and hopes it'll help him do his job or focus better. The payoff comes when the audio from the headphones clearly states \"This is a tutorial on how to properly make a chicken bowl\".

The worker is usually meant to hold a professional mask, where he/she gives a diplomatic answer, even when having less than good things to say. In this sketch, which is somewhat creative and amusing, a voice dub gives a diplomatic answer. But simultaneously, her body movements and erratic behaviour in the kitchen signals the opposite. It's an absurdist sketch that creates contrast between what is overdubbed as the voice over \"It was so, so good, everyone did exactly what they were supposed to do\", and her real answer that is seen by her movements and animated physical response. The hook and pacing is good. It's creative and original, and doesn't rely on music or sound. It's a video that can be replicatable quite easily. But it requires someone who can sell the concept, with engaging animated acting.",

This is of course an absurd way of interpreting the customers words, and for the video to become a montage of them eating together is a funny  and unexpected turn. The customer and server enjoying themselves and sharing food is surprising. The pacing is good, the hook is funny.

Can be replicated, but would require some planning and editing, as well as animated expressions to get the humour across.",

Then the second one simply stands there by the drink station, with drinks overfilling the cup and the colleague almost \"off line\", as if checked out mentally. This answers the question indirectly (she's not ok), with a funny visual representation of someone almost traumatized. This is an amusing and absurdist trope, the idea that a hectic service could make a person traumatized. It plays on the trope of a soldier being shocked by a situation, and then being hard to reach for a while after. This becomes a contrast to a restaurant setting, and makes it absurd for that reason.\n\nThe script is funny and original. It relies on a TikTok \"sound\", meaning a ready made sound that is being mimicked by the content creator. Generally, music or \"sounds\" are not good and I prefer clear and original scripts. The script can be replicated somewhat easily. It's not a dialogue heavy script and plays of physical humor, or the dramatic effect of seeing a visual representation of a funny scenario. Overall the pacing is also good, it's not too long or short. ",

The video has pacing, and the delivery by the cashier makes it chocking/absurdist, making the viewer think \"wow, that's funny but at the same time mean\". Of course, the viewer gets from the TikTok context that it is simply a sketch/joke. But this type of meanness/cruelty can be funny when viewed in an absurdist context.\n\nThe video is replicatable. The script has originality, and can be reused for any type of business with a cash register. Doesn't require too much setup or editing.",

The dialogue centers around the questioning character saying that the pizza is a circle in a square box, somewhat of an amusing observation. The other person gets annoyed. Then the questioning person says \"and now the slice is triangular\", which makes the dialogue move to another level. It's a funny little disagreement that is centered around an observation. This is a sketch that can be replicated somewhat easily. Requires two people and probably some good editing. Good acting would help. Likely that a pizza parlor would be the best business to recreate this script.",

She feels the price is too high, and the person behind her says that he'll pay. The twist is that he takes her card, and pays for her. And then he smiles to give his own order. This is somewhat humorous because the normal reason for someone to offer would be to pay, not to take their card and pay for them. It's a script that can be replicable, but requires some setup and planning to record. Perhaps requires 2-3 people as well. Funny and engaging, wholesome.",

The line \"Luckily he doesn't know English\" makes this joke pop, as it captures the ill will of the person, but humorous still. It's somewhat easy to replicate, and requires one person.

The humor becomes a bit exaggerated the customer brings a camera, which is normally associated with wanting to share with others. The barista, who may feel bigger and confident, starts walking into the camera and some music starts playing. This video is short and easy to replicate, but may not be the right tone for other restaurants. In it's current form, it requires a personality to seem \"larger than life\", wanting to exaggerate their unique style or play on that trope. It also contains music, which makes the sketch less capable to stand on it's own. It's short and would likely be engaging for young women, which might be their target audience looking at the tone and the type of video this is.",

This sets an unexpected expectation on the person, which moves the scene forwards to find out what he's going to do. The twist is that he goes in to do dishes in the restaurant, which is uncommon for a customer to do. It's somewhat absurdist and funny, but the pacing is a bit slow and it's not very original. But the payoff is good. Can be replicated somewhat easily, but requires around 3-4 people to reproduce (friend group, staff). ",

Men i alla fall, jag hade ett sällskap, en kvinna och hennes dotter som kom för att fira hennes födelsedag och de hade bokat bord och vi styr inte hur bokningarna lägger sig i restaurangen. Eh, men de hade fått ett bord i baren som hon var jättemissnöjd. Och det var tänk så här, det var fullbokat alltså det var fullt. Folk stod och köade på att få komma in. Eh, och det var jag och en till i servicen bara så ja ja, vi körde på och hon står där och eh matar mig med hur dålig servicen är och hon kommer aldrig komma tillbaka och eh ja, vice versa. Så till slut så eh får jag nog. Så jag vände mig om och jag bara, om inte du nöjd då kan du gå härifrån. Enkelt. Alltså folk måste ju börja respektera oss i den här branschen för jag är också så jävla trött på alla otrevliga eller så här tror att ni är bättre än alla oss. Eh, tyvärr, det är inte så. Vi gör vårt bästa och ni får helt enkelt bara köpa att ibland har vi mycket att göra och ibland så sitter vi i skiten. Tack för mig.",

The joke is that a somewhat annoying request, is met by the clerk throwing the food (unreasonable), and then saying \"of course, we don't do that\", and then slapping instead (making the clerk really unprofessional - and absurdist). But even for this script, they go even further and stop before the slap, saying \"of course we don't do that\", but this time, kicking the customer in the face instead.\n\nThe script can be replicated by other restauranteurs, or even be related to other business types. But it requires some method acting, which may not be what others what to create. In general, it's creative and amusing, playing on absurdist humor.",

This plays on the idea that men should normally pay, but the man resisting in an unexpected way (Especially if they are together). It turns out, with the continuation of the script, that the woman and man don't actually know each other which makes the woman's claim even more outrageous. This is seen in the last frame with the \"I don't even know you!\".\n\nThe humor is clever and original, and can be replicated by most restaurants. Of course, it requires some engaging acting between two people, which may be a barrier for some restauranteurs who prefer simple execution with one subject.",

The video ends with the man saying \"I don't even know who you are.\" The hook is strong because it immediately sets up a conflict and the pacing is good because the video moves quickly from one point to the next. The payoff is not as strong because it's not clear what the point of the video is, but it is still somewhat satisfying to see the man deny knowing the woman.",

The hook is compelling because it makes the viewer wonder what he won't admit or say, and the pacing is good because the video moves quickly. The payoff is satisfying because the viewer sees him eating the food, which is what he said he wouldn't do. The video is rewatchable because it is funny and relatable.",

The video is short and uses some physical humor.\n\nI don't think the video is useful for my purposes. First of all, the meme is not known online to be very creative or \"in\", so that any other creator/restaranteur would replicate the script with success. Also, it plays on the character in the cash register being very beautiful, which is a recurring theme which also gives it extra visibility.",

A child could enjoy this video because it's quite extreme, how the cashier would care about what condiment to add on the shawarma sandwich. The content creator has that as a recurring joke, and the video is a sort of movie trope about a very serious person that is needlessly serious. The reason why the video doesn't work for the purpose is that other restauranteurs wouldn't copy a concept that plays heavily on an inside/recurring joke. Also, it plays a lot on production value which makes it hard to replicate with a much smaller content budget",

It plays on a form of clichée that girls are edgy and like the feeling of showing off. It juxtaposes itself in an amusing way, where tacos is not the place to show of like that, especially not at work as the cashier.\n\nUltimately, for my purposes, it's not a very useful video since the script requires some physical comedy that may be hard to replicate for another restauranteur with another type of food. It would require a similar type of food, say a fast food joint, as well as the owner/worker being a young visually engaging woman.",
