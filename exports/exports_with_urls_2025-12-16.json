Men jag ska berätta om en gång när vi hade när vi precis hade öppnat det här stället och vi hade 50 % på hela matnotan. Alltså fattar ni vad ni har missat. De som vet de vet, de som var här. Men i alla fall, jag hade ett sällskap, en kvinna och hennes dotter som kom för att fira hennes födelsedag och de hade bokat bord och vi styr inte hur bokningarna lägger sig i restaurangen. Eh, men de hade fått ett bord i baren som hon var jättemissnöjd. Och det var tänk så här, det var fullbokat alltså det var fullt. Folk stod och köade på att få komma in. Eh, och det var jag och en till i servicen bara så ja ja, vi körde på och hon står där och eh matar mig med hur dålig servicen är och hon kommer aldrig komma tillbaka och eh ja, vice versa. Så till slut så eh får jag nog. Så jag vände mig om och jag bara, om inte du nöjd då kan du gå härifrån. Enkelt. Alltså folk måste ju börja respektera oss i den här branschen för jag är också så jävla trött på alla otrevliga eller så här tror att ni är bättre än alla oss. Eh, tyvärr, det är inte så. Vi gör vårt bästa och ni får helt enkelt bara köpa att ibland har vi mycket att göra och ibland så sitter vi i skiten. Tack för mig.",

The character (restaurant staff) has a long going inside joke that says that ketchup on shawarma is not ok. The sketch is taking a \"threatening\" interaction to an absurd level, because a young woman customer would not be problematic if she added ketchup on a shawarma. Of course, this joke isn't very replicable because the \"meme\" of the matter, ketchup on shawarma, isn't a culturally known idea outside of arab food, or even in general. This makes the core concept not replicable, but the tone and simplicity may be that.",
